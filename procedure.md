## Procedure

- The wet-bulb thermometer has a cloth wrapped around which is to be made wet with distilled water to get accurate result.
- Before taking a reading, the key should be tightened to rotate the fan and the instrument is left for 3 minutes.
- Then the wet-bulb and dry bulb temperature readings are taken.

## Simulation Procedure
#### Procedure to run the Simulator:

1. Click on the "Measure the Temperature" button first, to measure the fortin barometric pressure and the wet bulb and dry bulb temperature.
